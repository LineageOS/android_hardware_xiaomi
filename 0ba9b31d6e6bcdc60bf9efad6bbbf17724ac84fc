Always when getting an effect or just while reading one?\n\nRegarding the primitives - their effect id\u0027s are offestted by 32768, current patch set would just expect to find the primitive effect with id 0 as effect_32768.bin - would we rather want some more extensive logic to read primitive_effect_0.bin instead?",
